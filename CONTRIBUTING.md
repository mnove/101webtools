## Commit Message Guidelines

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.  
A commit hook is set up using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to enforce this standard automatically.

**Examples:**

- `feat: add password generator tool`
- `fix: correct SHA256 hashing bug`
- `docs: update README with new tool list`

If your commit message does not follow the convention, the commit will be rejected by the hook.

Thank you for contributing!
